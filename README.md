Click the Green Flag to begin sequence. 

Central blue-haired sprite stands in the middle of default backdrop.

Two selections are available represented as buttons (the left and right Aggretsuko characters).

Clicking the left 'Relax' icon will change the backdrop to a star gazing background where a 'Relax Repeat' audio track will begin to play. This will play three times with the Aggretsuko character "saying" a 'Relax Counter' that increments as the clip repeats until it hits three times. Afterwards, a 'Relax Continued' audio clip will play until it fades out. Central blue-haired sprite will alternate between two costume frames with a 1 second interval to simulate singing.

Click the Red Stop Sign to end the sequence and click Green Flag again to reset the scene to select other option.

Clicking the Right 'Slam Metal!' icon will change the backdrop to an industrial factory background where a 'Slam Intro' audio track will begin to play. This will play once. Afterwards, a 'Slam Repeat' audio clip will play three times with the Aggretsuko character "saying" a 'Slam Counter' that increments as the clip repeats until it hits three times. Central blue-haired sprite will alternate between two costume frames with a 2 second interval to simulate singing.

Click the Red Stop Sign to end the sequence and click Green Flag again to reset the scene.
